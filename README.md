# BatchProject
<h2>The repository containing a collection of Windows Command Prompt (CMD) Batch Files that I have created.</h2>

<p>This repository contains a collection of batch files that I created myself. I made it using only the Notepad application.
This may seem simple. you might even be able to create your own application. However, I hope that it will be useful for your daily needs and activities when using a Windows computer.</p>
<p>And the most important thing is that you don't need to bother putting together the code yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Use it wisely without harming others!</strong></p>
